This algorythm depicts the work of decision making mechanism for robot based on
3 ultra-range sensors allocated at diferent angel in front panel of robot to cover obstacles
in front of robot, from left and right.

To test the algorythm just run it in python idle;
enter distance in cm.

Algorythm will request sensors (in test case you should enter data instead of sensor)
to get distance and verify it couple of times
depending on how close obstacle is.

There are 3 checking algorythms - strong, light and medium.

After algorythm "ensures" the distance is correct - it will make decision for robot
to move in right direction, avoiding obstacle.
