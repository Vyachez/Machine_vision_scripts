Algorythm allows to build the plot of 3 sensor
vision depending on angles of sensors locations
relatively to eahc other:

VAR - means variable to change depending on your conditions

# VAR setting quantity of dots for sampling (sensor range in cm)
dot_quant = 150

# FIXED distance of side sensors relatively to central
# (this figures static due to pecularity of sensor locations for this example)
Cpoint = 0
Rpoint = 7.9
Lpoint = Rpoint * -1
r_side = 11.7
l_side = 10

# VAR - TUNABLE distance which side sensors should cross upfront
r_dist = 32
l_dist = 32

# VAR robot width/passing corridor
width_corr = 50

# VAR setting distance which side sensor should cover from center (wider that sensive corridor)
ss_vis = 70
